                    <h1>The Legend of The RABBIT MAN</h1>
         <p> Legend says that the infamous Rabbit Man is just a wealthy citisen that<br> 
             fights crime when it arises. Is he actually a rabbit with a hunky male body?<br>                              Some think it's a costume, while most people are convinced otherwise.<br>
             Evryone describes him like James Bond with a rabbit face, and the ladies<br>
             just can't get enough.</p>
