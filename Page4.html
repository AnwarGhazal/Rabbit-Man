        <h1>Why is Rabbit Man so hard to spot in NYC?</h1>
        <p> Everyone knows where he's been by the graffitti and beautiful works of art<br>
            you see all over town.The thing is he's so fast, you won't even see him coming,<br>
            like art ninja. He has an amazing ability to camouflague into his surroundings,<br>
            which make him nearly impossible to see. He moves fast weather walking<br> 
            or throwing up graffitti on the wall, he works like he's on fast forward.</p>
